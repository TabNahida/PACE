**Instrumented diagnostic run. Timing overhead is included; these results are not a fair backend comparison.**

| Backend | Instrumented requests/s (median) | Min–max requests/s | p50 µs¹ | p95 µs¹ | p99 µs¹ | Max µs¹ |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|

¹ Median of each trial's percentile or maximum; not pooled percentiles or the overall worst request. JSON preserves every metric's min/max across trials.

| Backend | Whole-process peak memory MiB (median) | Min–max MiB | OS source |

Peak RSS/working set includes the server, identical blocking clients and stored latency samples. It includes startup/warmup and is read after shutdown, before result aggregation. Version 2 measures the current process image; unsupported providers report n/a, never zero. Linux VmHWM accounting is approximate. This does not isolate library footprint; compare only the same workload and OS.

3 trials per backend; one server thread; 32 persistent connections; 64-byte payload; one outstanding request per connection; 10000 measured + 1000 warmup requests per connection per trial.

Loopback results describe this workload on this machine, not general superiority or multicore/HTTP performance.

Environment and commands: `environment.json`. Every run: `raw.jsonl`.
